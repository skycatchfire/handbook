## Paid Time Off

Paid Time Off (PTO) is anything that keeps you from working like a vacation, feeling sick, or just need time away. Employees are encouraged to schedule time off whether it's for travel or just to get things done around the house.

Our policy for PTO is very flexible. We believe that our employees should be responsible to plan vacations and time off that won't negatively impact the business.

It's expected that employees take vacations and time off. We don't limit this time per year.

To schedule time off:

1. Confirm that it won't negatively impact your projects by not being available during that time. Consider other team members that might have already scheduled overlapping time off and how that might impact your projects also.
2. Add your time off to the shared [PTO calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/b/1?cid=Y18xNHVqOG9sOTloamttMXZjNWtpOGlrZGN0OEBncm91cC5jYWxlbmRhci5nb29nbGUuY29t).
3. Add your time off to the [PTO spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WHRMrQ57liLpu9vSsKXdQIIh-c3U3pzlUCPiFJFaKvo/edit#gid=0).

## Observed Holidays

SKYCATCHFIRE takes the days off between Christmas Day and New Year’s Day as well as the following national holidays:

- New Year's Day
- Memorial Day
- Independence Day
- Labor Day
- Thanksgiving Day
- Christmas Day

## Personal Leave

If you are under treatment or recovery for a serious medical condition and are unable to work for a week or more because of it, let us know and you can take four weeks off at 100% pay. If after that, you're still unable to work, SKYCATCHFIRE will continue to pay you 50% of your pay until you're better, up to twelve weeks off. These days are an emergency reserve, separate from your vacation/sick time described above. If after this period of time, you still cannot work have a discussion with Ryan to determine a plan.

## Family Leave

If you are the primary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 6 weeks leave at 100% paid salary. If you are the secondary caregiver of a new child, you can take up to 4 weeks leave at 100% paid salary. You may also choose to take additional leave unpaid as the primary or secondary caregiver. This time is meant for bonding with the new child and should commence from the date of birth or placement. Every situation is different so if you have questions, reach out and we'll have a conversation about it.

## Bereavement Leave

When you lose a loved one, you can take paid time off from work for bereavement, making arrangements, settling family affairs, and attending the funeral or memorial service. Let your manager know your plans as soon as you can so they can arrange for your absence.

You can take ten days of bereavement leave for the death of a spouse or partner, child or child-in-law, parent or parent-in-law, or sibling or sibling-in-law. You can take three days of bereavement leave for the death of a grandparent, niece or nephew, cousin, or close friend. These caps are not to say you must return to work after so many days; you can use any of your available vacation time if you find you need more time off after bereavement leave.

## Retirement Plan

Our 401K is through John Hancock. SKYCATCHFIRE will make a Safe Harbor Matching Contribution dollar-for-dollar up to 3% of your salary. For those contributing 5% or more, the company will contribute up to 4% of your salary. You are eligible to enroll in the 401K plan after 90 days of employment.

## Employee Profit Sharing

SKYCATCHFIRE shares a percentage of its annual company profits with employees, which is distributed in shares based on tenure. Profits are distributed after the books are closed on the previous fiscal year, usually around March (e.g. 2020 profits distributed in March 2021).

You’re eligible to participate in profit sharing after two years of working at SKYCATCHFIRE. You’ll accrue more shares each year at SKYCATCHFIRE, and you’ll max out your shares at 10 years. We calculate shares based on months of tenure so there’s no unfair cliff between being hired in December vs January.

In addition to tenure, employees are awarded additional shares based on overall performance for that given year. Performance is determined based on several metrics including but not limited to the outcome of your annual Employee Performance Review.

Any compensation from this program is a gift and shouldn't be something you budget for or expect. Year to year, profits and therefore the amount available to share with employees may fluctuate or not be paid out at all.

This program does not have a set expiration date, but the company reserves the right to amend it or cancel it at any time. You forfeit your shares in the profit sharing program if you resign or are terminated from SKYCATCHFIRE.

# Perks

## Summer Fridays

During summer, we work a half day on Friday, aka "summer fridays". From May 1 - August 31 we work half day every Friday (9a - 12p). Put in a solid week, wrap up your tasks Friday morning, and then go enjoy the extended weekend. Friday lunch is still on but it's not required.

## Friday Lunch

It's tradition that the team goes out somewhere together for lunch every Friday. This typically includes a vote to determine where, some car pooling to get there, and some beers with good conversation.

## Snacks & Office Supplies

Every week, the team adds whatever we might need to [the Instacart order](https://www.instacart.com/store/buehlers/storefront). This includes anything from trash bags or paper towels to coffee and candy. Since we don't have an office manager, we crowd source the inventory management for anything we use in the office. As you notice we are running low on something or think of something that would help, please add it to the Instacart order to be delivered the following Thursday.

## Workspace Allowance

It's important that you have the tools you need to do your best work. Each employee will be equipped with a MacBook Pro, multiple 4K displays, keyboard, mouse, and a standing desk. If you'd like a particular type of mouse or keyboard or could use something else to improve your workspace, just ask!
